# Cloudcost

## Description

Cloudcost provides detail into AWS EC2 costs at a level not provided by Amazon.

Cost can be sliced by
 * instance
 * key/value metadata

Cost can be aggregated by
 * month-to-date
 * instance lifetime

_Note that EC2 cost detail prior to use of Cloudcost is unavailable. Cloudcost needs to know when instances start and stop (i.e. needs to be running) to calculate cost accurately._
